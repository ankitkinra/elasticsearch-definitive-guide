== Looking at time

If search is the most popular activity in Elasticsearch, building date
histograms must be the second most popular.  Why would you want to use a date
histogram?

Imagine your data has a timestamp.  It doesn't matter what the data is -- Apache
log events, stock buy/sell transaction dates, baseball game times
-- anything with a timestamp can benefit from the date histogram.  When you have
a timestamp, you often want to build metrics which are expressed _over time_.

- How many cars sold each month this year?
- What was the price of this stock for the last 12 hours?
- What was the average latency of our website every hour in the last week?

While regular histograms are often represented as bar charts, date histograms
tend to be converted into line graphs representing time series.  Many
companies use Elasticsearch _solely_ for analytics over time-
series data.  The `date_histogram` bucket is their bread and butter.

The `date_histogram` bucket works very similar to the regular `histogram`.  Rather
than building buckets based on a numeric field representing numeric ranges,
it builds buckets based on a time ranges.  Each bucket is therefore defined as a
certain calendar size (e.g. `1 month` or `2.5 days`, etc).

.Can a regular histogram work with dates?
****
Technically, yes.  A regular `histogram` bucket will work with dates.  However,
it is not calendar-aware.  With the `date_histogram`, you can specify intervals
such as `1 month`, which knows that February is shorter than December.  The
`date_histogram` also has the advantage of being able to work with timezones,
which allows you to customize graphs to the timezone of the user, not the server.

The regular histogram will interpret dates as numbers, which means you must specify
intervals in terms of milliseconds.  And the aggregation doesn't know about
calendar intervals, which makes it largely useless for dates.

Our first example will build a simple line chart to answer the question:
how many cars were sold each month?

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /cars/transactions/_search?search_type=count
{
   "aggs": {
      "sales": {
         "date_histogram": {
            "field": "sold",
            "interval": "month", <1>
            "format": "yyyy-MM-dd" <2>
         }
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 300_Aggregations/35_date_histogram.json
<1> The interval is requested in calendar terminology (e.g. one month per bucket)
// "pretty"-> "readable by humans". mention that otherwise get back ms-since-epoch?
<2> We provide a date format so that bucket keys are pretty

Our query has a single aggregation, which builds a bucket
per month.  This will give us the number of cars sold in each month.  An additional
"format" parameter is provided so that the buckets have "pretty" keys.  Internally,
dates are simply represented as a numeric value.  This tends to make UI designers
grumpy, however, so a prettier format can be specified using common date formatting.

The response is both expected and a little surprising (see if you can spot
the "surprise"):

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
   ...
   "aggregations": {
      "sales": {
         "buckets": [
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-01-01",
               "key": 1388534400000,
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-02-01",
               "key": 1391212800000,
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-05-01",
               "key": 1398902400000,
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-07-01",
               "key": 1404172800000,
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-08-01",
               "key": 1406851200000,
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-10-01",
               "key": 1412121600000,
               "doc_count": 1
            },
            {
               "key_as_string": "2014-11-01",
               "key": 1414800000000,
               "doc_count": 2
            }
         ]
...
}
--------------------------------------------------

The aggregation is represented in full.  As you can see, we have buckets
which represent months, a count of docs in each month, and our pretty "key_as_string".

=== Returning empty buckets

Notice something odd about that last response?

Yep, that's right.  We are missing a few months!  By default, the `date_histogram`
(and `histogram` too) only returns buckets which have a non-zero
document count.

This means your histogram will be a minimal response.  Often, this is not the
behavior you actually want.  For many applications, you would like to dump the
response directly into a graphing library without doing any post-processing.

Essentially, we want buckets even if they have a count of zero. There are two 
additional parameters we can set which will provide this behavior:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /cars/transactions/_search?search_type=count
{
   "aggs": {
      "sales": {
         "date_histogram": {
            "field": "sold",
            "interval": "month",
            "format": "yyyy-MM-dd",
            "min_doc_count" : 0, <1>
            "extended_bounds" : { <2>
                "min" : "2014-01-01",
                "max" : "2014-12-31"
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 300_Aggregations/35_date_histogram.json
<1> This parameter forces empty buckets to be returned
<2> This parameter forces the entire year to be returned

The two additional parameters will force the response to return all months in the
year, regardless of their doc count.  The `min_doc_count` is very understandable:
it forces buckets to be returned even if they are empty.

The `extended_bounds` parameter requires a little explanation.  The `min_doc_count`
parameter forces empty buckets to be returned, but by default Elasticsearch will
only return buckets that are between the minimum and maximum value in your data.

So if your data falls between April and July, you'll only have buckets
representing those months (empty or otherwise).  To get the full year, we need
to tell  Elasticsearch that we want buckets even if they fall _before_ the
minimum value or _after_ the maximum value.

The `extended_bounds` parameter does just that.  Once you add those two settings,
you'll get a response that is easy to plug straight into your graphing libraries
and give you a graph like this:

=== Extended Example

Just like we've seen a dozen times already, buckets can be nested in buckets for
more sophisticated behavior.  For illustration, we'll build an aggregation
which shows the total sum of prices for all makes, listed by quarter.  Let's also
calculate the sum of prices per individual make per quarter, so we can see
which car type is bringing in the most money to our business:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
GET /cars/transactions/_search?search_type=count
{
   "aggs": {
      "sales": {
         "date_histogram": {
            "field": "sold",
            "interval": "quarter", <1>
            "format": "yyyy-MM-dd",
            "min_doc_count" : 0,
            "extended_bounds" : {
                "min" : "2014-01-01",
                "max" : "2014-12-31"
            }
         },
         "aggs": {
            "per_make_sum": {
               "terms": {
                  "field": "make"
               },
               "aggs": {
                  "sum_price": {
                     "sum": { "field": "price" } <2>
                  }
               }
            },
            "total_sum": {
               "sum": { "field": "price" } <3>
            }
         }
      }
   }
}
--------------------------------------------------
// SENSE: 300_Aggregations/35_date_histogram.json
<1> Note that we changed the interval from `month` to `quarter`
<2> Calculate the sum per make
<3> And the total sum of all makes combined together

Which returns a (heavily truncated) response:

[source,js]
--------------------------------------------------
{
....
"aggregations": {
   "sales": {
      "buckets": [
         {
            "key_as_string": "2014-01-01",
            "key": 1388534400000,
            "doc_count": 2,
            "total_sum": {
               "value": 105000
            },
            "per_make_sum": {
               "buckets": [
                  {
                     "key": "bmw",
                     "doc_count": 1,
                     "sum_price": {
                        "value": 80000
                     }
                  },
                  {
                     "key": "ford",
                     "doc_count": 1,
                     "sum_price": {
                        "value": 25000
                     }
                  }
               ]
            }
         },
...
}
--------------------------------------------------

We can take this response and put it into a graph, showing a line chart for
total sale price, and a bar chart for each individual make (per quarter):

=== The sky's the limit

These were obviously simple examples, but the sky really is the limit
when it comes to charting aggregations.  For example, here is a dashboard in 
Kibana built with a variety of aggregations:

[[kibana-img]]
image::images/300_35_kibana.png["Kibana - a real time analytics dashboard built with aggregations"]

Due to the real-time nature of aggregations, dashboards like this are easy to query,
manipulate and interact with.  This makes them ideal for non-technical employees
and analysts who need to analyze the data but cannot build a Hadoop job.

To build powerful dashboards like Kibana, however, you'll likely need to some of
the more advanced concepts such as scoping, filtering and sorting aggregations.
